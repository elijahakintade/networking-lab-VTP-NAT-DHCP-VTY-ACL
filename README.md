# Packet Tracer – Network Services and Security Lab

This repository contains my Cisco Packet Tracer lab focused on implementing and securing key network services.  
The lab demonstrates essential configurations across switching, routing, and access control to simulate real-world enterprise network environments.

---

## 🔧 Key Configurations

- **VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol):** Centralized VLAN management across multiple switches.  
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Enables internal hosts to access external networks securely.  
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automates IP address assignment and network parameter distribution.  
- **VTY Line Security & SSH:** Secures remote access to network devices through encrypted management sessions.  
- **ACLs (Access Control Lists):** Controls traffic flow and enhances network security with precise filtering rules.
